## Streamlining the analysis of phishing emails using Artificial Intelligence

Institutions today face a growing challenge in combating increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks, which can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. 
Many institutions struggle to effectively identify and respond to these threats, especially when dealing with customized phishing attempts that bypass conventional filters. 
This thesis addresses this critical issue by proposing the development of a framework designed to improve the identification of phishing emails and strengthen the response capabilities of their cybersecurity teams.
