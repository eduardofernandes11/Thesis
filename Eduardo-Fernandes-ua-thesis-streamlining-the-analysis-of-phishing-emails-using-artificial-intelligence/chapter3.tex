\section{Work Plan}

In this section is presented the work plan for this thesis. In Figure \ref{fig:c3:gantt_chart} is displayed a Gantt chart which maps the timeline of each task in the development process. The purpose of this work plan is to ensure a systematic approach to the development and writing of this thesis. It reflects a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to tackling a complex and dynamic problem in cybersecurity. The work plan is divided into three main phases: \textit{Research}, \textit{Development} and \textit{Writing}, not being treated separately but rather as a continuous process.
